# JS-Fundamentals

This project contains basic JavaScript scripts that introduce variables, constants, printing, and running JS with Node.js.

## Task 0: First constant, first print

Write a script that prints:


### Requirements
- Create a constant variable named `myVar`
- The value must be `"JavaScript is amazing"`
- Use `console.log()` to print the output
- Do not use `var`
- Run the script using: `node 0-javascript_is_amazing.js`
